# Spradling-WoodsAssignment1

One thing I learned from the reading is that a frame buffer holds the pixel information. I didn't know how that worked before and found that really interesting.

I also found this line in the reading interesting: "the availability of inexpensive solidstate memory led to the universality of raster displays." Is this an example of solid state technology being used in RAM before we had hard drives using Solid State technology? I am curious to know more about this.
